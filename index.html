<p>Hello, I'm Teresa Caldwell. I’m currently working as a Junior Software Developer
  for healthcare marketing firm in the <a href="https://www.boston.gov/" target="_blank">Boston</a> area. Also, I am finishing my Master’s degree in Software Development
  from Boston University. I have previously attended a coding bootcamp in 2017 where I learned Full-stack Development using
  web technologies such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Python. Following bootcamp
  I then worked as Web Developer in the Finance sector in Charlotte, NC. </p>

<p>Overall, I have about 3 years of technical experience
working in various roles in technology and engineering in Support engineering,
Web Development, and my current role as Junior Software Developer. Currently I focus on frontend technologies
like HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. I also take care of our backend database using SQL server as well as any updates
